<h1>What is it about?
<h6>1-It is a full-dynamic web application allowing to save patient datas admissed and examined on database and 
to make changes over these datas.

2-All warnings checking validations of data entrances in system are available. For instance; in case of intersection
of appointment time and patients' phone numbers, not to be able to appointment admission and so on.

3-In order to be able to be made patient follow-up rapidly and effectively, patient name searching and pagination are available.

4-The most striking aspect of system is existance of an automatic control mecanism notifying that the appointment time has come
for any patient whose appointment has come. When it is five minutes left for apppointment time, appointment data belonging to the
patient turn into yellow color. If appointment time has passed, automatic control mecanism carry appointment data of the patient
to allocated field for "Passed Appointments".

5-The application has the last version being ready for use. Thanks to all these features, folow-up of thousands of patients easily.


<h3>How it's made?
<h6>6-While React, Redux, Material UI ve Boostrap libraries have been used in Frontend section of construction stage, JSON Rest Api
has been used in Backend section. In all stages, Javascript ES6 standarts have been used.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
